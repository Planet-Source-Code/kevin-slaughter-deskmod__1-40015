## DeskMod


</div>

### Description

Since your desktop is one big ListView, this sits in the systray and allows you to easily change the viewmode of your desktop icons.

DM uses an INI to store your last preferance, and will reset the viewmode to normal when you exit.

VB form menus are now no longer used, and have been replaced with API menus that are created dynamically on each request, so they don't stay in memory (what little bit it would use anyway).
 
### More Info
 
Command line usage has been removed from v2.4

When the viewmode is switched to "Normal" after being set to Tiles, they icons are a bit more spaced apart horizontally than they normally would be. Nothin' major.
